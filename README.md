## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the slider and toggle to see prices for different page view numbers

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Interactive Price Component](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- TypeScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this project to put my understanding of TypeScript to use. I just started learning it recently.

If you want to edit the javascript, edit the typescript file, then compile it.

Run `tsc` in the root of the folder to compile the code.

If you don't have the typescript compiler, run `npm i -g typescript`, then run the previous code.

### Continued development

I want to build more projects in the future to solidify my understanding of typescript and learn how to use it with some frontend frameworks.
